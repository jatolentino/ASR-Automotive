{{term|[[brake]]}}{{anchor|brakes}}
{{defn|Any device designed to apply friction to a moving or moveable surface in order to slow it, stop it, or prevent it from moving, especially one that slows, stops, or prevents the rotation of one or more of the wheels of an automobile. Most wheeled vehicles are built with at least one brake for each wheel, which can be applied either independently of each other or, in four-wheeled vehicles, all at the same time, by depressing one or more foot-operated {{gli|brake pedals}} or {{gli|handbrake|hand-operated levers}}. If the vehicle is already in motion, the act of applying the wheel brakes, known as ''braking'', will ultimately cause the entire vehicle to slow or stop as the friction generated by the contact between the tires and the ground overcomes the vehicle's inertia. If the vehicle is stationary, the same brakes or a separate brake may also be applied to prevent the wheels from rotating while the vehicle is parked. There are many types of brakes which operate on a wide variety of physical principles. Modern automotive {{gli|braking systems}} rely on a large and complex network of precisely controlled mechanisms in order to deliver optimal {{gli|braking pressure}} for specific road conditions, to prevent brakes from {{gli|locking}} and overheating, to reduce the amount of input required from the driver, and ultimately to maximize safety, efficiency, and durability.<ref name="Lane"/>}}

Four-wheel drive can provide greater {{gli|traction}} when road conditions are suboptimal, but typically has negative effects on {{gli|fuel efficiency}} and {{gli|handling}} at speed.

This is a consequence of the fact that a tire's lifespan is often strongly biased by its particular position on the vehicle (e.g. front or rear, driver's side or passenger side) because the masses supported by and the forces applied to different parts of the vehicle are often uneven; for example, in {{gli|front-engine}} vehicles, the front axle typically supports a much greater load than the rear axle, meaning the tires on its wheels experience different forces that may cause their {{gli|tread}} to wear out faster than the tread on the rear tires.}}
